## Operatino Steps
0. The Turtlebot moves while avoding obstacles, the moving algorithm is based on Q-Learning
1. While the robot moves, the pantoscopic camera reconize the human face. the face detection is based on the MobileNet, SSD
2. If the robot detects the face, the thermal camera will be activated
3. The thermal camera extracts the area of temperature by giving the coordinate from the pantoscopic camera
4. The thermal camera confirms the thermal
5. If the temperature increase beyond a certain degree, the sound device will issue a warning.
